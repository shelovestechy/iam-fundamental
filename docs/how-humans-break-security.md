# How Humans Break Security — Without Trying To

Most security failures are not caused by attackers.
They are caused by normal people trying to do their work.

Humans rarely wake up and decide to break security.
Security breaks because systems are designed without human reality in mind.

## The false assumption

Many security designs start from one assumption:
users will behave as expected.

They will:
- Read instructions
- Understand warnings
- Follow processes
- Stop when something feels wrong

In real work this assumption fails quickly.

## Work pressure beats policy

Users are measured by productivity.
Security is often invisible in those measurements.

When security slows work:
- People look for shortcuts
- Rules become flexible
- “Just this once” becomes normal

This is not rebellion.
It is adaptation.

## Habit is stronger than awareness

Security controls often rely on attention.
Humans rely on habit.

When users:
- Approve MFA prompts many times a day
- Reset passwords often
- Click through warnings that rarely matter

the brain stops evaluating each action.

Security becomes background noise.

Attackers know this.
They design attacks around habit, not ignorance.

## Confusion creates compliance theater

When security rules are unclear,
people stop asking questions.

They do what worked last time.

Examples:
- Approving MFA because it usually fixes the problem
- Writing passwords down because resets are painful
- Calling the Service Desk and saying whatever helps

The process looks compliant.
The behavior is not secure.

## Humans trust systems that help them

When security tools are:
- Predictable
- Explained
- Integrated into daily work

people trust them.

When tools are:
- Random
- Noisy
- Poorly explained

people work around them.

Security that fits work is used.
Security that fights work is bypassed.

## The Service Desk effect

Many security decisions happen in conversations.
Not in systems.

Service Desk agents:
- Reset credentials
- Verify identity
- Grant temporary access
- Calm stressed users

If agents are rushed or unsupported,
security bends.

If agents are trained and backed up,
security holds.

## IAM perspective

IAM often focuses on systems and rules.
Human behavior is treated as a risk to manage.

In reality human behavior is a design input.

Strong IAM assumes:
- Users will take shortcuts under pressure
- Habits will override training
- Clarity reduces risk more than warnings
- Support roles are part of access control

## What actually reduces human-driven risk

Not more rules.
Not more warnings.

What helps:
- Clear and predictable security flows
- Short and repeated guidance instead of one big training
- Context shown at the moment of decision
- Making the secure choice the easy choice
- Supporting people when they slow down for security

## Key takeaway

Humans do not break security because they are careless.
They break it because systems are designed without them in mind.

Security that respects human behavior
is stronger than security that tries to control it.

Good IAM does not fight people.
It works with them.
