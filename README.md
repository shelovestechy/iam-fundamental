# IAM Fundamentals

<hr style="border:none; height:2px; background:#f3c1d9; margin:16px 0;" />

This repository is a practical IAM portfolio focused on identity lifecycle thinking,
access design, and real-world risk scenarios.

The content reflects how Identity & Access Management works in real organizations:
not as isolated technical features, but as processes that evolve over time.

<p style="color:#d99abf;">
IAM is as much about clarity and restraint as it is about access.

## What's inside
- **Core IAM concepts** (IAM, IGA, PAM, CIAM)
- **Identity lifecycle** (Joiner–Mover–Leaver)
- **Access models** (RBAC, ABAC, hybrid approaches)
- **Conditional Access** and contextual risk
- **Incident, risk, and design case studies** based on realistic IAM scenarios

## Structure
- `docs/` — written analysis, design reasoning, and case studies
- `diagrams/` — simple diagrams to support lifecycle and access concepts

## Why this exists
This repository demonstrates IAM thinking rather than tool-specific configuration.
It focuses on clarity, structure, and understanding how small design decisions
affect long-term security, risk, and maintainability.
