- **AD vs Entra ID** basics and hybrid reality
- **Conditional Access** and risk-based access decisions
- **Common risks & controls** (MFA, least privilege, access reviews)

## Structure
- `docs/` — short, focused explanations and written analysis
- `diagrams/` — simple diagrams (PNG/SVG) to visualize IAM models and flows

## Why this exists
This repository is part of an IAM-focused portfolio.
Its purpose is to demonstrate clear thinking, structured documentation, and a risk-aware approach to identity and access management.
