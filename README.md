# IAM Fundamentals

This repository is a practical, beginner-to-intermediate overview of Identity & Access Management (IAM).
Focus: core concepts, common models, and how IAM decisions reduce real-world risk.

## What's inside
- **Core IAM concepts** (IAM / IGA / PAM / CIAM)
- **Identity lifecycle** (Joiner–Mover–Leaver)
- **Access models** (RBAC, ABAC and hybrid approaches)
- **AuthN vs AuthZ** (authentication vs authorization)
- **AD vs Entra ID** basics and hybrid reality
- **Common risks & controls** (MFA, least privilege, conditional access thinking)
  
## Structure
- `docs/` — short notes and explanations
- `diagrams/` — simple diagrams (PNG/SVG) to visualize models

## Why this exists
I’m building an IAM-focused portfolio that demonstrates clear thinking, documentation, and risk-based design.
